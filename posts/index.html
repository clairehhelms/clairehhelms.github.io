The Moon is responsible for a natural rhythm that shapes the tides, the circalunar clocks of nature, and the consistency of seasons. On the more romantic side, the Moon is well-known for its presence in songs, poems, paintings, and other musings (not to mention the pop culture references&mldr; I&rsquo;m looking at you, Twilight).</p><p>Still, however familiar we feel with the Moon, most of us have never inspected it more closely than with the naked eye. I remember my first time viewing the Moon through a telescope and gazing in wonderment at its perfectly-defined craters lowlighted by shadows. I also remember recently showing my partner the same thing, and his reaction was even better than my own.</p><p>It is only natural, then, that the Moon is the first object I capture in my astrophotography class. To create my image, I used an observation made by Alex Shoaf on the PROMPT-6 optical telescope in Chile using Skynet Robotic Telescope Network&rsquo;s interface. Because the field of view on PROMPT-6 is smaller than the Moon itself, we observed the Moon in a 3x3 dithering pattern, creating a grid of 9 seperate images which we stitched together using Afterglow.</p><p>We also took multiple exposures of each image, which we correlated to colors. For red, we took an exposure in H-alpha; for green, in OIII; and for blue, a blue filter. By layering these three colored images atop each other, a more natural color image was created!</p><p><img src=moons_color.png alt="Red, green, and blue moons"></p><p>After stacking, I played with typical photograph attributes, like saturation, temperature, contrast, and exposure. I also rotated the image. My final image could perhaps still use some tampering, but I like the way I brought out the blues of the Moon&rsquo;s maria and kept the brighter highlighted areas of the craters.</p><p><img src=moon_colored.png alt="Final colored moon"></p><p>Ultimately, I am happy with what I&rsquo;ve learned from capturing the Moon, and I can&rsquo;t wait to create more images!</p></div></article><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2023 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
