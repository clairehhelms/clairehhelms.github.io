When thinking of our solar system siblings, we may have fond memories of creating a <a href=https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Solar-System-Model>planet diorama</a>, or maybe we reminisce on the <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/learning/do-you-think-pluto-should-be-a-planet.html>great Pluto debate</a>.</p><p>Yet, most of us do not have an accurate mental image of these planets, especially because we cannot see them well with our eyes or basic telescopes. At best, we can see tinted specks of light; however, each planet in our solar system has a complex atmosphere, which correlates to a distinct color. Closer (and larger) planets like Mars and Jupiter are easier to capture in color, but father and dimmer planets like Uranus and Neptune are a bit tricker. Keep reading as I explain how I captured each of these beauties!</p><p>To create all of my images, I gathered the raw photos from a Mars observation made by myself, a Jupiter observation made by LillyAnn &ldquo;Tiger&rdquo; Nekervis, and Neptune and Uranus observations made by our instructor, Daniel Reichart. For each planet&rsquo;s image set, I used Afterglow to adjust the planet&rsquo;s position in the images to be consistent across all images – this helps with aligning and stacking to create our red, green, and blue colored layers!</p><p>For Mars and Jupiter, I adjusted the colors by eye. Although the resolution is far from the professional images created by astrophotographers, my main goal was to find a color balance that matched the pros&rsquo; images! Below are a side-by-sides of professional images and my own!</p><p><img src=/mars.png alt=Mars>

My Jupiter image on the left with a Jupiter image from Casini on the right.</p><p>I wanted to bring out Mars&rsquo;s red-orange surface created by the large amounts of iron oxide (rust) in its soil, but I also wanted to keep the whites of Mars&rsquo;s permanent ice caps. With Jupiter, I aimed to bring out the saturation of its many bands, which result from the many different chemicals that compose Jupiter and the different velocities of gases and winds in said bands.</p><p>Another exciting feature of Jupiter are its four bright moons! Because the brightness of the moons is much smaller than the brightness of Jupiter, we have to adjust the brightness of our image to view the moons, eliminating any detail on Jupiter:</p><p><img src=/jupiter_moons.png alt="Jupiter&amp;rsquo;s moons">
Notice how Io is yellower than the other moons – this is due to the large amounts of sulfur across Io&rsquo;s surface!</p><p>&ndash;</p><p>For Neptune and Uranus, we are able to capture the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; color of the planets and their moons by using their surroundings! Essentially, by matching our images&rsquo; background stars with catalogued stars, we are able to calibrate our images&rsquo; colors with the recorded &ldquo;natural&rdquo; colors of the stars, revelaing the color of the planets as a byproduct. Again, these images are fairly low-resolution, but they match the coloration taken by professionals!</p><p><img src=/uranus.png alt=Uranus>
