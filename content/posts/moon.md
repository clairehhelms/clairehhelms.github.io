## THE MOON

Earth's natural satellite, humans' perpetual muse, and mythology's anti-sun. The Moon is responsible for a natural rhythm that shapes the tides, the circalunar clocks of nature, and the consistency of seasons. On the more romantic side, the Moon is well-known for its presence in songs, poems, paintings, and other musings (not to mention the pop culture references... I'm looking at you, Twilight). 

Still, however familiar we feel with the Moon, most of us have never inspected it more closely than with the naked eye. I remember my first time viewing the Moon through a telescope and gazing in wonderment at its perfectly-defined craters lowlighted by shadows. I also remember recently showing my partner the same thing, and his reaction was even better than my own.

It is only natural, then, that the Moon is the first object I capture in my astrophotography class. To create my image, I used an observation made by Alex Shoaf on the PROMPT-6 optical telescope in Chile using Skynet Robotic Telescope Network's interface. Because the field of view on PROMPT-6 is smaller than the Moon itself, we observed the Moon in a 3x3 dithering pattern, creating a grid of 9 seperate images which we stitched together using Afterglow.

We also took multiple exposures of each image, which we correlated to colors. For red, we took an exposure in H-alpha; for green, in OIII; and for blue, U. By layering these three colored images atop each other, a more natural color image was created!

After stacking, I played with typical photograph attributes, like saturation, temperature, contrast, and exposure. I also rotated the image. My final image could perhaps still use some tampering, but I like the way I brought out the blues of the Moon's maria and kept the brighter highlighted areas of the craters.

Ultimately, I am happy with what I've learned from capturing the Moon, and I can't wait to create more images!
