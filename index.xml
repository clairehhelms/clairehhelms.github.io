&lt;p>Earth&amp;rsquo;s natural satellite, humans&amp;rsquo; perpetual muse, and mythology&amp;rsquo;s anti-sun. The Moon is responsible for a natural rhythm that shapes the tides, the circalunar clocks of nature, and the consistency of seasons. On the more romantic side, the Moon is well-known for its presence in songs, poems, paintings, and other musings (not to mention the pop culture references&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you, Twilight).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, however familiar we feel with the Moon, most of us have never inspected it more closely than with the naked eye. I remember my first time viewing the Moon through a telescope and gazing in wonderment at its perfectly-defined craters lowlighted by shadows. I also remember recently showing my partner the same thing, and his reaction was even better than my own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is only natural, then, that the Moon is the first object I capture in my astrophotography class. To create my image, I used an observation made by Alex Shoaf on the PROMPT-6 optical telescope in Chile using Skynet Robotic Telescope Network&amp;rsquo;s interface. Because the field of view on PROMPT-6 is smaller than the Moon itself, we observed the Moon in a 3x3 dithering pattern, creating a grid of 9 seperate images which we stitched together using Afterglow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also took multiple exposures of each image, which we correlated to colors. For red, we took an exposure in H-alpha; for green, in OIII; and for blue, a blue filter. By layering these three colored images atop each other, a more natural color image was created!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="moons_color.png" alt="Red, green, and blue moons">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After stacking, I played with typical photograph attributes, like saturation, temperature, contrast, and exposure. I also rotated the image. My final image could perhaps still use some tampering, but I like the way I brought out the blues of the Moon&amp;rsquo;s maria and kept the brighter highlighted areas of the craters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ultimately, I am happy with what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from capturing the Moon, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to create more images!&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
